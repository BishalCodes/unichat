# Unichat - Coding Skills Practice

Unichat is a coding project designed for practicing and enhancing your coding skills. In this project, you will work
with various technologies, including Axios for API communication, Firebase for user authentication with Google and
Facebook, and a chat engine for real-time messaging.

## Tech Stack

The Unichat project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests in both the browser and Node.js.

- **Firebase**: A cloud-based platform that provides authentication services, including Google and Facebook login
  integration.

- **Chat Engine**: A real-time chat engine that simplifies the process of building chat applications.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BishalCodes/unichat
   ```
2. Install NPM packages (both client & server)
   ```sh
   npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..
   ```
3. Set up Firebase::

- Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Configure Firebase authentication to enable Google and Facebook login.
- Update your Firebase configuration in the project.

4. Set up Chat Engine:

- Configure Chat Engine and obtain API keys if required.
- Update the Chat Engine configuration in the project.

5. Start both client & server
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Build the project for production (both client & server)
   ```sh
   npm run build && cd client && npm run build && cd ..
   ```

7. Start the development server alternatively
   ```sh
   vite
   ```

8. Start the development server over network
    ```sh
    vite --host
    ```

### Usage

Unichat is a practice project, so feel free to experiment and enhance your coding skills in the following areas:

- Making API requests using Axios.
